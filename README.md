# Fundamentals of Computer Science
This repository contains materials and exercises related to the **Fundamentals of Computer Science** course, offered in the first semester of Applied Computer Science at AGH University of Krakow.

## Course Overview
The course introduces students to the basics of algorithmic thinking, numerical representations in computer systems, fundamental computer architecture, and operating systems. It also provides an introduction to **C programming**.

## Laboratory Exercises
Laboratory exercises were conducted to develop practical skills in:

- **Binary arithmetic and number representation:** Converting numbers between different positional numeral systems and performing arithmetic operations.
- **Control structures in C:** Implementing loops, conditionals, and logical expressions.
- **Turing Machines and algorithmic problem-solving:** Creating simple Turing Machines to solve basic algorithmic problems.
- **Data structures in C:** Working with variables, arrays, and pointers.
- **Basic procedural programming:** Writing simple C programs utilizing procedural paradigms.
- **Boolean algebra and logic operations:** Applying logical operations to programming and computational problems.
- **Basic memory management in C:** Understanding and using static and dynamic memory allocation.
- **Computer organization and architecture:** Understanding CPU operations, instruction cycles, and addressing modes.
- **Operating system fundamentals:** Exploring process scheduling, memory management, and deadlocks.

All programming tasks and exercises were designed to build a strong foundation in computational thinking, programming, and system-level operations.
